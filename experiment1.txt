In this experiment, we simulated playing the vanilla version of the MCTS bot against itself, 
one with a static 100 nodes/tree, and the other with varying amounts of nodes/tree. We tested
with values of 50, 100, 500, and 1000. With 50 nodes/tree, (half of its opponents), the bot
lost most of its matches, winning 33 out of the 100 games. This makes sense given that it's
considering far fewer actions before making it's decision each turn. With 100, (the same as
its opponent) the result was 51 wins, which is statistically appropriate given they are even
matches. Then with 500 the number of wins rises dramatically up to 85, marking how significant
the jump from 100 to 500 is in terms of it's ability to deduce better decisions. Finally, from
500 to 1000, the bot won 87 times, a very slight improvement over 500. Despite having twice as
many nodes as its predecessor, the 1000 nodes/tree bot only won two additional matches. This
shows how the returns begin to diminish significantly as the number of nodes/tree increases.
